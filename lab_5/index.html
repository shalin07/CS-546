        <p>
	    My name is Shalin Barot. I'm from India and I was born and brought up in Ahmedabad(Gujarat) where i lived for 21 years. I always wanted to be professional soccer player but I ended up being a Computer geek who now loves to code.
	    I was captain of my undergrad soccer team for 2 years and use to play as Attacking MidFielder for my team. Apart from playing I also love to watch soccer, I'm a die hard Real Madrid fan.

        <p> 
	    Rightnow I'm working as Teaching Assistant of Statiscal Machine Learning and also doing research in Recommendation system under Prof. Dr Jie Shen. I love to play with data and want to be a Data Scientist. I have done couple of
	    projects where I have used machine learning algorithms and have also implemented a mini search engine using Trie Tree in python. I also love developing website in my free time. My preferred language is Python for machine learning
	    and javascript for development.
